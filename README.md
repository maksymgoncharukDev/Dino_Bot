ðŸ¦– Dino Bot
A simple Python bot that automatically plays the Google Chrome Dino game by detecting obstacles and pressing the jump key (spacebar).

ðŸ“¸ How It Works
Captures a portion of the screen where obstacles appear.

Converts the captured image to grayscale.

Detects any obstacle by checking if pixel brightness is below a certain threshold.

Simulates a jump by pressing the spacebar.

Loops continuously with a small delay for efficient performance.
